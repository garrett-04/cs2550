    <h2> Kids are something else </h2>
    <p> A little something for my my new found freind. His only interests in me is my VR headset but claims he is my best friend.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Ronan is my freind <br> All he wants is my fun games <br> Kids can be funny </p>
    <h2> My personal interests </h2>
    <p> One of my biggest interests is hunting and fishing. I grew up fishing a ton but have more
        recently got into hunting. I just really like being in the outdoors with nature. So far, my 
        favorite hunt has been the ducks, something about hunting them is just really fun (even though
        they don't taste very good!) 
    </p>
    <p> Another one of my interests is playing video games! I grew up playing video games so it has been
        apart of my life for a long time. Video games are super stress relieving for me and so it's nice
        to have that sort of thing when life gets hard. I like to play all types of games so I can't say 
        that I have a favorite game. Recently, I've built a computer so it has been awesome to be able to
        play games on that. 
    </p>
    <p> Another interest of mine is military airplanes! I have only recently found a love for them but that
        love has skyrocketed in the past couple of years. My favorite aircraft is the A-10 Warthog. It is an 
        attack aircraft for the United States Aircraft, I really like it because it has a huge gun on it. I 
        some of the coolest parts about military aircraft is how fast they are and how loud they can be! 
        I have been able to go to some air shows over the past couple of year and they have been really 
        awesome to go to!
